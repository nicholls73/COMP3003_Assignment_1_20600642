ABOUT THE GAME:
  Protect the castle in the middle from the robots. You can place walls down by clicking on squares,
  although there is a max of 10 walls that can be placed at a time. There is also a timed queue on
  how quickly walls can be placed.

  Each robot moves in random directions at random times. If a robot walks into a wall then the robot is destroyed
  and the wall will either be damaged or destroyed, depending on the state.
